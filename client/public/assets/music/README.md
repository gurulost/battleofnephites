# Music Assets

This directory contains the music tracks for the Battles of the Covenant game.

## Music Files
- `theme.mp3`: Main theme music played during menu screens and gameplay
- `battle.mp3`: Intense music played during combat sequences

## Adding New Music
When adding new music tracks, make sure they are:
1. In MP3 format
2. Loopable (seamless transitions when repeating)
3. Named consistently with the existing naming scheme
4. Added to the `musicFiles` object in the `useAudio.tsx` file
